# nbpuller
An extension for jupyter notebook to retrieve and update local files from remote git repository using native git pull and merge.

## Installation

You can currently install this directly from git:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/data-8/nbpuller.git
jupyter serverextension enable --py nbpuller
jupyter nbextension install --py nbpuller
```

To enable this extension for all notebooks:

```
jupyter nbextension enable --py nbpuller
```

## Usage

nbpuller can be activated through a link in the following format:

```
<notebook_url>/interact?<settings>
```

`<settings>` has the form of URL query strings, with the following possible parameters:

| Field name    | Required / Default |
|---------------|--------------------|
| domain        | "github.com"       |
| account       | "data-8"           |
| repo          | REQUIRED           |
| branch        | "gh-pages"         |
| path          | REQUIRED, can be multiple |
| notebook_path | ""                 |

The remote git repo url is constructed as follows:
`https://<domain>/<account>/<repo>.git`

Files at each `<path>` of the given branch will be retrieved using git.

Alternative setting will be:

| Field name    | Required / Default |
|---------------|--------------------|
| file_url      | REQUIRED           |

<file> should be a url. An example is `?file_url=http://localhost/README.md`

## Expected behavior

If the destination folder is empty, nbpuller will `git clone` remote repo.

If the destination folder exist, in general, nbpuller tries to do `git pull` and merge with `-Xours` parameter, if necessary. In the case that there is any change in the folder, nbpuller will `git add` all of them and commit them, before pulling and merging.
